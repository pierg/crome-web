# make sure that your dns has a cname set for emby
# if emby is running in bridge mode and the container is named "emby", the below config should work as is
# if not, replace the line "set $upstream_app emby;" with "set $upstream_app <containername>;"
# or "set $upstream_app <HOSTIP>;" for host mode, HOSTIP being the IP address of emby
# in emby settings, under "Advanced" change the public https port to 443, leave the local ports as is, set the "external domain" to your url and subdomain,
# and set the "Secure connection mode" to "Handled by reverse proxy"
