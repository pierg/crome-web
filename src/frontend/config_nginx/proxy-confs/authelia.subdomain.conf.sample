# make sure that your dns has a cname set for authelia
# the default authelia-server and authelia-location confs included with letsencrypt rely on
# subfolder proxy at "/authelia" and enabling of this proxy conf is not necessary.
# But if you'd like to use authelia via subdomain, you can enable this proxy and set up your own
# authelia-server and authelia-location confs as described in authelia docs.
